Be here now.
Be the change you wish to see in the world.
Do no evil.
Remember: this too shall pass.
Take everything in moderation.
Judge not, that ye be not judged.
Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.
Hatred does not cease by hatred but only by love.
Peace comes from within. Do not seek it without.
