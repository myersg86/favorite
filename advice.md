Be here now.
Be the change you wish to see in the world.
Remember: this too shall pass.
Be grateful.
Everything in moderation.
Judge not, that ye be not judged.
Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.
Help others.
Do no harm.
Hatred does not cease by hatred but only by love.
Practice compassion.
Peace comes from within. Do not seek it without.
