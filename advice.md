Be here now.
Be the change you wish to see in the world.
Remember: this too shall pass.
Take everything in moderation.
Judge not, that ye be not judged.
Do unto other as you'd like others to do unto you.
Hatred does not cease by hatred but only by love.
Sell your cleverness and buy bewilderment.
Peace comes from within. Do not seek it without.
