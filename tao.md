Life can be easy,
but people prefer to make it difficult.
Be aware when things are out of balance,
Stay centered.

When rich speculators prosper
while farmers lose their land;
when governments spend tax money
on weapons instead of cures;
when the upper clase is extravagant and irresponsible,
while the poor have nowhere to turn -
all this is robbery and chaos.
This is not the natural order of the universe,
this is not the way to enlignenment.
